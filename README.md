Ryan Downey 2D Game Development Project

So far attached is my project: Roby. It is a 2D platformer that takes inspiration from Mario, Mega Man, and other platformers I grew up playing. So far the only functional control for the game are the ADW keys for movement.

Common Deliverables Complete:
- The entity system is viewable in entity.c/entity.h
- The game map is fully interactable
- The HUD for what power up drive Roby has is on the screen.
- All level and entity data is defined in the JSON files in the repository
- The README is right here.
- All assets are consistent. Sprites were made from scratch via piskel and (unused) audio in the repo recorded by me
- Main menu can be seen in the game
- Research component: Finite State Machine AI - Each enemy has their own finite state machine for behavior and enemy.c has the machines implemented. ai.h has state enum defintion only.

Personal Deliverables Complete:
- The platforming gameworld and physics are functional and viewable through play
- The 5 pickups/items spawn on the screen
- The 5 abilities are seen from picking up the batteries in the level
- The 5 enemies are seen in the level
