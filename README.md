Ryan Downey 2D Game Development Midterm

So far attached is my project: Roby. It is a 2D platformer that takes inspiration from Mario, Mega Man, and other platformers I grew up playing. So far the only functional control for the game are the ADW keys for movement.

Common Deliverables Complete:
- The entity system is viewable in entity.c/entity.h
- The game map is fully interactable
- The HUD for what power up drive Roby has is on the screen, but won't change due to the power ups not being done. However, I can prove that it does change.
- All level and entity data is defined in the JSON files in the repository
- The README is right here.

Personal Deliverables Complete:
- The platforming gameworld and physics are functional and viewable through play
- The 5 pickups/items do spawn on the screen but I couldn't get the collisons to work so they do not activate
